# Security Policy

With Land of the Rair, "security" concerns anything from this list, and possibly more:

- Duplication bugs (copying an item via use of an exploit)
- Account hijacking bugs (taking over someone elses account)
- Character hijacking bugs (taking over someone elses characters)
- Silver bugs (anything related to the buying of silver)
- Crash bugs (anything that crashes the game)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find something so serious that other players _should not_ know about it, email me at `security@rair.land`. I will likely respond within a few days at most and be working on a fix within a week.
